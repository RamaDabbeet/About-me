# About-me

👋 HI there,

I'm a data Geek 📊  Lately, I've fallen head over heels for Python 🐍, leaving behind my JavaScript days 🌐.

🧙‍♂️ Data analysis is like solving puzzles for me. Python and Pandas have become my trusty companions on this journey (And, of course, Power BI is my little babe, always there when I need it!🤓) .

🌟  Although I started with JavaScript (you can see it in my earlier projects), it was nothing to impress you, merely the first baby steps. But data analysis stole my heart, and I found myself diving headfirst into it.

🚀 I'm a genuine admirer of AI. constantly exploring how AI can elevate the world of data.

📈 When I'm not deeply involved with data, you'll find me passionately reading & exploring the latest in the world of technology and AI advancements. 

🤓 I'd love to connect, share our data adventures, and explore the fascinating realms of Python and AI together, genuinely!
